Prompt 34: Claude, Design a Scalar-Interactive Surface Shader System with Biometric Coherence Coupling
Objective:

Create a system where digital surfaces, interfaces, and textures respond dynamically to user scalar state (via Ra coherence model) and environmental torsion fields. This is ideal for things like “responsive UI halos,” “coherence-modulated material textures,” or “consent-aware digital membranes.”

Source References:

SCALAR_TORSION_ANTIGRAVITY.md — Use: torsion-induced refractive index shifts, spin-induced structural transformations

ELECTROMAGNETIC_HEALING_FREQUENCIES.md — Use: frequency ranges to associate surface resonance to user state

Ra.Biometrics.Pipeline — Use: coherence value, field stability, bioharmonic alignment

Ra.Visualizer.Surfaces — New module (or extension of .Shell)

Deliverables:

Shader State Model:

data SurfaceState = 
  SurfaceState 
    { coherenceLevel :: Double
    , torsionSpin    :: SpinState  -- Clockwise | Counter
    , resonanceFreq  :: Double     -- Hz
    , permissionGate :: ConsentLevel
    }


Surface Style Resolver:

resolveSurfaceStyle :: SurfaceState -> ShaderParams


Maps scalar state to:

Refractive distortion (torsionSpin)

Hue shift (resonanceFreq)

Alpha transparency / hardness (coherenceLevel)

Interactivity zone (permissionGate = Suspended, Passive, Engaged)

Consent Surface Overlay:

When permissionGate == Suspended, show translucent “bio-dome” field

Override shaders show turbulence if user coherence < 0.2

Environment Surface Hooks:

Surfaces store base BioHarmonicSignature

When touched or hovered, surfaces check:

alignment :: BiometricSnapshot -> Bool

If aligned: increase bloom/emissive state

If misaligned: introduce turbulence visual

Success Criteria:

Surfaces visibly react within 200ms of biometric changes

“Suspended consent” overlays appear automatically and retract on restoration

Scalar spin toggles correctly invert shaders across torsion axes

Surfaces return to neutral state after inactivity timeout (e.g., 30s)
