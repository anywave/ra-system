Suggestion: Focus Thread Consolidation

Here are a few high-impact focus zones you might consider consolidating effort around before branching further:

🧠 Core Biometric → Coherence Loop

Ensure:

Signal ingestion works (mock + real)

Coherence mapping is testable and visualized

Feedback loop with the scalar field is closed

Modules: ra.pipeline, ra.scalar, ra.chamber, ra.visualizer.shell

🎵 Scalar Harmonics → Musical Expression

Finalize:

RaNoteline notation format

Fragment-to-sound mappings

Avatar timbral modifiers

Modules: ra.music, keely.vibratory, ra.constants.harmonics

🧬 Emergence Logic & Fragment Consent

Validate:

evaluateEmergence logic paths including shadow states, coherence floor

Consent coupling edge cases (NoRelation, Suspended, Override)

Modules: ra.emergence, ra.fragment, ra.consent, ra.identity

📡 Chamber Environment Modeling

Stabilize:

Field chamber definitions (portable, personalized, collective)

Tuning operations (influx, entrainment, entropy checks)

Modules: ra.chamber, ra.field.bus, ra.constants.geometry

🛠 Dev & Testing Infrastructure

Expand:

HSpec property tests with ra.pipeline.types

Visual integration checks with ra.visualizer.shell

Constants registry (ra.constants.extended)
