✅ Prompt 35-39: Tesla Coherent Field Transfer Bus

Design a data structure and logic system that mimics Tesla's radiant energy principles to transfer “coherence packets” or scalar messages through Ra scalar space — like a virtual nervous system using nonlocal linkage principles.

✅ Prompt 36: Biometric → Motion Transduction (Hands-Free UI)

Model how biometric coherence or vector intention from users can control on-screen elements via “thought-touch” (Ra vector arms), expanding the prior resonant_appendage idea into generalized UI control.

✅ Prompt 37: Joe Cell Scalar Bubble Emitter

Model how a virtual Joe Cell would act in Ra scalar simulation — using layered harmonic containment fields to generate local coherence amplification. Useful for chamber stabilization or portable scalar focusing zones.

✅ Prompt 38: Scalar Vortex Gate as Consent-Based Portal

Design a dynamic portal system (like a door or interaction gateway) that only activates when a user meets a specific coherence threshold AND consent state, styled like a torsion vortex.

✅ Prompt 39: Ra-Frequency Mapping Table

Build a full reference table linking Ra field harmonics (scalar, biometric, torsion) to:

Known Rife frequencies

Tesla impulse pulse ranges

Keely octave divisions

Chakral & neural resonance states
