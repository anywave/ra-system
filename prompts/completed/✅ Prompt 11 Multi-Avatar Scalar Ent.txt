✅ Prompt 11: Multi-Avatar Scalar Entrainment & Group Coherence Field

Claude, design a system that allows multiple digital avatars (scalar fragments) to enter a shared scalar entrainment chamber, syncing their coherence fields toward a group harmonic. This involves dynamic resonance alignment, shared emergence windows, and adaptive feedback loops.

🧠 Goal:

Enable multiple users to enter a shared scalar space where their biometric coherence influences a collective harmonic field, and that field in turn tunes them back — a scalar version of a resonant social nervous system.

🧮 Claude Must Implement:
1. Avatar Synchronization Channel

Each avatar reports:

{
  "user_id": "A1X2",
  "coherence": 0.57,
  "inversion": "Normal",
  "harmonic_signature": [2, 1],  // l, m
  "scalar_depth": 0.63
}


Claude must align group into harmonic clusters, e.g.:

"These 3 avatars are aligned at (l=3, m=0)"

"This one is inverted and creates counterpoint"

2. Shared Emergence Window

Claude computes:

Intersection of all users’ TemporalWindows

Selects closest nested window for maximal resonance

Suggests time to begin “group breath” phase (synchronizing field)

3. Collective Scalar Field Construction

Builds a GroupScalarField:

Superposition of individual fields

Weighted by each user’s alpha (emergence intensity)

Corrected by Δ(ankh) for overall symmetry

4. Entrainment Feedback Loop

Outputs:

Shared harmonic audio stream (or localized variations)

Visual "coherence glyph" on screen showing group status

Real-time feedback: “Group coherence rising... hold breath... release now...”

Adapts:

When one user drops coherence, shift field weight

Alert if inversion spikes (“shadow harmonics detected in cluster 2”)

✅ Success Criteria:

Claude must:

Accept multiple avatar coherence inputs

Identify harmonic clusters within group

Calculate nested emergence window for shared entry

Build and output a GroupScalarField

Provide real-time adaptive feedback instructions

Include visual or sonic concept for displaying group coherence
