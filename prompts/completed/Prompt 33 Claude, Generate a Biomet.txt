Prompt 33: Claude, Generate a Biometric-to-Avatar Scalar Expression Pipeline Using Torsion and Radiant Parameters
Objective:

Design a real-time pipeline that takes live biometric input and maps it to visible avatar field expressions in AVACHATTER using principles from scalar torsion physics, morphogenetic coherence, and radiant frequency modulation. This powers an expressive biofield halo or avatar aura layer.

Source References:

SCALAR_TORSION_ANTIGRAVITY.md — Use: spin-polarized charge separation, massless torsion field effects, aether-mediated field rotation

RIFE_LAKHOVSKY_SPECIFICATIONS.md — Use: harmonic bandpass correlation, biofrequency radiant zones, antenna-like biological entrainment

Ra.Visualizer.AvatarField — Output system (live visual shell modulation)

Ra.Biometrics.Pipeline — Biometric input sampler

Deliverables:

Pipeline Function:

expressAvatarField :: BiometricSnapshot -> AvatarFieldModulation


Converts coherence, HRV, respiration phase, and scalar tension into:

Hue shift

Torsion spiral density

Oscillation tempo

Radiant bloom expansion

Field Model:

Avatar fields are expressed as nested torsion shells.

Each shell oscillates at a BioHarmonic(n), defined by:

data BioHarmonic = Alpha | Theta | PhiCrown | RootShift | AnkhFold


Use scalar spin polarity from SCALAR_TORSION_ANTIGRAVITY.md to calculate shell spin (clockwise = coherent, counter = disrupted)

Resonance Zone Model:

Divide avatar space into zones (Crown, Chest, Root, etc.)

Each reacts to biometric deltas:

HRV drop = torsion field turbulence at chest

Respiration coherence = bloom expansion at crown

Breath-hold = spin halt in solar plexus

Fallback Static Rendering:

If real-time loop unavailable, create a declarative avatar field state from most recent BiometricSnapshot

Success Criteria:

Avatar visually expresses changes in user coherence within 0.2s latency

Scalar spin flips (torsion reversal) when coherence crosses φ/ankh threshold

Radiant field hues match predicted BioHarmonic zones from Lakhovsky bands

Field amplitude resets after user disengagement
