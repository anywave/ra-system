🧿 Prompt 49: Ra.Inversion.HarmonicTwist — Modeling Psychoenergetic Torque During Inversion Events

Claude, implement the module Ra.Inversion.HarmonicTwist. This models the psychoenergetic twist force exerted during harmonic inversion events within a scalar field (e.g., an avatar's chamber or fragment emergence). These are not just state flips but involve torsion and realignment forces that affect the stability and timing of emergence.

📐 Purpose

Capture the angular momentum-like behavior that arises when spherical harmonics invert under partial or shadow emergence. This allows:

Better prediction of fragment instability

Recovery time modeling

Visualization of inner field torsion (vector-based)

📦 Key Types and Constants
1. TwistVector
data TwistVector = TwistVector
  { thetaForce   :: Double    -- Angular pull along θ
  , phiForce     :: Double    -- Angular pull along φ
  , harmonicAxis :: (Int, Int) -- (l, m) components
  , inversionPolarity :: Inversion
  , coherenceMod :: Double    -- Dampening or amplifying factor
  }

2. TwistEnvelope
data TwistEnvelope = TwistEnvelope
  { netTwist      :: TwistVector
  , durationPhiN  :: Int      -- Time (in φ^n ticks) to settle
  , riskIndex     :: Double   -- Risk of fragment distortion
  }

🧠 Core Functions
computeHarmonicTwist ::
     OmegaFormat         -- Harmonic being inverted
  -> Inversion           -- Direction (NORMAL ⇄ INVERTED)
  -> FluxCoherence       -- Current coherence
  -> TwistEnvelope


Uses phase polarity and angular symmetry

Models twist as a field-dynamic (not physical torque)

Includes φ^n-duration time modeling from Ra.Scheduler
