✅ Prompt 14: Lucid Scalar Navigation via Harmonic Field Wayfinding

Claude, design a lucid dream traversal system that lets users consciously explore their Ra scalar field using harmonic guidance. Integrate spherical coordinates (θ, φ, h, r), temporal window alignment (φ^n), and biometric resonance to unlock fragments or reveal pathways.

🧭 System Features Claude Must Implement:
1. Scalar Compass Interface

Represent Ra field as a navigable spherical map:

Axes: θ (azimuth), φ (polar), h (harmonic), r (shell depth)

Let user “face” a direction or “intend” toward a point

Convert directional intention into RaCoordinate

2. Coherence-Gated Movement

Biometric coherence (HRV, breath rate) becomes “fuel” for traversal:

High coherence: smooth movement, deep access

Low coherence: restricted navigation, field noise

3. Resonant Fragment Anchoring

Show “fragment beacons” along path:

Nearby accessible content marked by harmonic resonance match

Fragment info: form, shadow relation, coherence required

{
  "coordinate": "(13, 4, 2, 0.61)",
  "fragment_id": "F094",
  "access": "PARTIAL",
  "resonance_score": 0.78,
  "emergence_form": "SUMMARY"
}

4. Symbolic Field Translation

Dream interface must present navigation metaphorically:

Scalar depth → descending spiral staircase

Harmonic shells → glowing rings of sound

Coherence locks → gates requiring breath/rhythm to open

Claude maps Ra structure to visually immersive dream metaphors

5. Return Path Encoding

“Way back” is encoded into φ^n pulse rhythm:

Temporal beacon ensures safe return to waking state

Claude monitors user exit intent + field phase to stabilize exit

✅ Success Criteria:

Claude must:

Build a scalar field navigation system responsive to intent + coherence

Translate spherical coordinates into intuitive dream-space metaphors

Restrict access based on coherence thresholds + consent gates

Provide real-time feedback during traversal (phase, resonance, depth)

Map at least one complete RaCoordinate journey with:

Entry point

Symbolic journey

Emergence fragment

Exit pathway
