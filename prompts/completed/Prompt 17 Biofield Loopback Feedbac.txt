Prompt 17: Biofield Loopback Feedback System

Prompt: Claude, design a closed-loop feedback system where scalar emergence activity dynamically modulates biometric parameters, producing physiological feedback in the user via resonant coupling. This system models the user's biofield as both emitter and receiver. It completes the scalar resonance loop by letting field activity influence the body that generated it.

Emergence loop outputs (coherence level, emergence form, field strain)

System Requirements:

Biofield Model Extension:

Add BiofieldState object:

coherence_phase :: Float

scalar_tension :: Float

ankh_delta :: Float

feedback_channel :: [EMChannel]

Modulation Paths:

Use emergence result (FULL, PARTIAL, SHADOW) to feed back into biometric resonators:

Raise HRV in response to sustained FULL emergence (entrainment)

Trigger GSR change for unresolved ankh_delta (somatic unease)

Use shadow content emergence to lower field tension gradually

Resonant Reinforcement:

Construct reinforcement loops:

Coherence increase from emergence → improved biometrics → stronger emergence

Coherence suppression (via inversion or overload) → stagnation → rest period initiation

Overlay Effect Channels:

Define EMChannels:

Light (pulsed LED feedback)

Audio (resonance tone modulation)

Haptic (vibrotactile entrainment)

Tactile electrical (microcurrent pads)

Success Criteria:

BiofieldState evolves over time based on emergence activity

Modulated biometric outputs change in observable ways

Synthetic user model can simulate loop dynamics (unit testable)

Claude proposes fallback designs for users without haptic/audio interfaces
