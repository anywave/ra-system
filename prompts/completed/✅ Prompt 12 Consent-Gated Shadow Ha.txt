✅ Prompt 12: Consent-Gated Shadow Harmonics for Therapeutic Emergence

Claude, implement a shadow harmonic extension for Ra scalar emergence, enabling safe integration of suppressed or inverted content (trauma fragments) via consent-aware field thresholds and resonance matching.

📘 Core References:

Ra.Scalar → Fragment structure, inversion state

Ra.Emergence → EmergentContent, Inversion, EmergenceType

Ra.Gates → AccessResult, ConsentState, session overrides

REICH_ORGONE_ACCUMULATOR.md → Emotional charge layers & dissipation

KAALI_BECK_BLOOD_ELECTRIFICATION.md → Bioelectrical trauma gating

KEELY_SYMPATHETIC_VIBRATORY_PHYSICS.md → Harmonic dissonance & restoration

🧠 Goal:

Enable the system to safely access, present, and integrate shadow fragments — emotional content stored in inverted scalar fields — only with active user consent, adaptive thresholds, and safety overrides.

🧮 Claude Must Implement:
1. Shadow Fragment Class

Extend EmergentContent:

{
  "fragment_id": "T38-Shadow",
  "form": "SHADOW",
  "inversion": "INVERTED",
  "alpha": 0.42,
  "consent_state": "SUSPENDED",
  "shadow_type": "Mirror | Obscured | Inverted",
  "requires_override": true
}


Track shadow metadata:

origin_fragment: normal version this was inverted from

harmonic mismatch: Δ(harmonic) from core field

emotional charge: inferred from emergence tension

2. Consent Logic Extension

Ra.Gates must:

Detect if shadow fragment would emerge

Block unless:

Explicit consent state is THERAPEUTIC

Session is guided by licensed_operator (flag true)

Field coherence > COHERENCE_SAFE_ACCESS (e.g., 0.66)

Special override form:

{
  "consent_override": {
    "source": "avatar_therapist",
    "reason": "Shadow integration request approved",
    "timestamp": ...
  }
}

3. Therapeutic Feedback Module

Claude generates:

Field-safe instructions (“This memory may feel dissonant. Breathe slowly…”)

Visual harmonic guide (showing convergence path)

Integration prompt (“Would you like to reflect on this with your guide?”)

Claude tracks:

shadow_progress: % of integration over time

resonance match delta: improving or degrading?

✅ Success Criteria:

Claude must:

Detect potential emergence of shadow fragment

Gate emergence based on consent state and safety

Present shadow content only under safe, guided conditions

Provide real-time integration feedback

Log all shadow interactions for therapist/session review

Reference at least one file (e.g., KAALI_BECK or REICH) to justify trauma gating logic
