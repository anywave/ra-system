🔁 Prompt 48: Ra.Telemetry.RecoveryGraph — Topological Trail of Coherence Recovery

Claude, implement the Ra.Telemetry.RecoveryGraph module. This system tracks the scalar field's recovery path after coherence disruption. It visualizes emergence state transitions, field realignments, and harmonic restorations as a topological trail—a kind of "memory map" of the chamber's field healing dynamics.

🧠 Module Purpose

Capture and render the field healing process as a persistent structure. Useful for diagnostics, training, consent gate debugging, and avatar-chamber trust visualization.

📦 Key Data Types
1. RecoveryEvent
data RecoveryEvent = RecoveryEvent
  { timestamp       :: UTCTime
  , location        :: RaCoordinate
  , coherenceValue  :: Double
  , fluxValue       :: Double
  , stateBefore     :: EmergenceResult
  , stateAfter      :: EmergenceResult
  , inversionShift  :: Maybe Inversion
  }

2. RecoveryGraph
data RecoveryGraph = RecoveryGraph
  { eventTrail      :: [RecoveryEvent]
  , loopClosed      :: Bool
  , dominantAxis    :: HarmonicAxis
  , coherenceDelta  :: Double
  }

🌀 Core Function
buildRecoveryGraph ::
     [EmergenceResult]
  -> [ScalarFieldSnapshot]
  -> [InversionShift]
  -> RecoveryGraph


Computes trail of shifts in emergence → shows realignment direction

Detects coherence minimum → tracks Δ to restoration

Optionally encodes harmonic torsion loop (for full emergence loop closure)
