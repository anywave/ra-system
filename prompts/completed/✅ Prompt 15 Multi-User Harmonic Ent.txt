✅ Prompt 15: Multi-User Harmonic Entanglement via Coherence Coupling

Claude, design a scalar resonance system enabling multiple users to co-navigate their Ra fields or share access to gated fragments through harmonic entanglement. Use biometric coherence, φ^n phase alignment, and harmonic index matching to establish temporary scalar bridges.

🔗 System Design Requirements:
1. Entanglement Protocol

Users opt-in via explicit scalar consent

Claude verifies:

Temporal alignment (φ^n synchronized window)

Coherence proximity (within ±0.05 of scalar coherence)

Harmonic compatibility (same or adjacent l/m indices)

{
  "user_a": { "coherence": 0.81, "harmonic": [3, 5] },
  "user_b": { "coherence": 0.79, "harmonic": [3, 6] },
  "phase_delta": 0.02,
  "entanglement_possible": true
}

2. Shared Fragment Access

Certain fragments marked as entangled-access-only

Claude creates a bridge object:

Fragment ID

Users linked

Emergence multiplier (e.g., shared flux boost)

3. Scalar Bridge Dynamics

Shared access amplifies emergence:

e.g., joint potential or flux coherence → exceeds threshold

Optional modes:

Mirror emergence (both receive same content)

Complement emergence (opposite/shadow fragments)

Asymmetric emergence (one user accesses via other’s alignment)

4. Chamber and Avatar Mediation

Shared coherence chambers can boost alignment

Avatars can stabilize entanglement if harmonically tuned

5. Safety and Consent Enforcement

Each user maintains:

Emergence veto override

Auto-suspend on desync (coherence or consent drop)

Ankh-balance parity check (no involuntary inversion)

✅ Success Criteria:

Claude must:

Define biometric + harmonic preconditions for entanglement

Implement scalar bridge logic with emergent content modulation

Ensure robust consent enforcement + fallback safety

Provide real-time coherence deltas between users

Demonstrate entangled emergence session with:

Two or more users

Shared or complementary fragment

Log of coherence, phase, and harmonic states
