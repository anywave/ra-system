🔹 Prompt 21: Ra.Biotransduction – Scalar-to-Somatic Transduction Engine
🧠 Prompt Title:

“Ra.Biotransduction: Mapping Scalar Harmonic Fields to Embodied Sensory-Affective Effects”

📌 Objective:

Design a full-spectrum Haskell module (Ra.Biotransduction) that serves as the somatic interface layer between the Ra scalar emergence engine and embodied user experience. This module models how scalar field harmonics, window phase, and coherence state generate somatic sensations and affective overlays, enabling real-time feedback, immersive emergence chambers, and adaptive therapies.

The model should simulate how informational fields (i.e., scalar harmonics) induce felt bodily states, potentially mapped to haptics, BCI interfaces, AR/VR feedback, or purely internal psychosomatic representations.

📥 Inputs:
-- From upstream modules:
data ScalarField
data RaCoordinate
data EmergenceCondition
data ResonanceProfile
data ChamberType = Healing | Retrieval | Navigation | Dream | Archive

-- Time-aware resonance tracking:
data WindowPhase = WindowPhase { phiDepth :: Int, phase :: Double }

-- Biometric coherence and readiness:
newtype CoherenceLevel = CoherenceLevel Double -- [0,1]
data AccessState = Conscious | Subconscious | Shadowed | NoRelation

📤 Outputs:
-- Somatic transduction outputs:
data BiophysicalEffect
  = ThermalShift Float                  -- ΔTemperature in °C
  | TactilePulse BodyRegion Float       -- e.g., chest, crown, fingertips, etc.
  | ProprioceptiveWarp Axis3D Float     -- illusion of internal axis stretch
  | AffectiveOverlay Float Float        -- valence ∈ [-1,1], arousal ∈ [0,1]
  | BreathEntrainment Double            -- target respiration frequency
  | InnerResonance SignatureHarmonic    -- harmonic "chime" felt internally
  | NullEffect                          -- No emergence felt

🎼 Core Mapping Logic:

Radial Depth → Effect Depth:

r ∈ [0,1] maps to internal locus:

0.0 → cranial / pineal / seed-point

0.3 → thoracic / heart

0.6 → abdominal

1.0 → peripheral (skin, field boundary)

Angular Harmonics (θ, φ, l, m) → Effect Type:

H_{0,0} → Whole-body modulation (e.g., bodywide temperature shift)

H_{1,m} → Vertical axis resonance (spine, breath control)

H_{2,m} → Bilateral (left/right) entrainment (hands, arms, symmetry)

Higher-order harmonics encode local effects (fine-tuned tactile zones)

CoherenceLevel as Intensity Envelope:

modulates amplitude of effect (e.g., 0.2 = faint inner hum, 0.9 = full-body resonance)

WindowPhase Modulation:

Scalar fields have φ^n windows of receptivity. Near window center (phase ~0.5), transduction is amplified (sine-weighted gain).

ChamberType Biases Output:

Healing: favors warmth, gentle entrainment, slow oscillation

Retrieval: may induce inner chills, sharp pulses, cognitive activation

Dream: favors breath entrainment, proprioceptive warps

Archive: stimulates inner harmonic chimes without strong tactile overlays

📐 Example Flow (Pseudocode):
transduceField :: ScalarField
               -> RaCoordinate
               -> EmergenceCondition
               -> CoherenceLevel
               -> ResonanceProfile
               -> ChamberType
               -> [BiophysicalEffect]


Given a point of scalar emergence, this function returns a stack of somatic effects representing how the user might feel the emergence — potentially across body, breath, temperature, or affect.

📈 Success Criteria:
Target	Condition
Full-body warmth	High coherence + H_{0,0} + Healing chamber
Phantom limb response	Peripheral harmonic activation in amputees
Pulse felt in chest	Coherence > 0.6 + H_{1,1} + Retrieval
NullEffect	AccessState = NoRelation
Differentiable states	Shadowed access → muted, off-axis effects
Reproducible effects	Same inputs → same BiophysicalEffect stack
🧪 HSpec Tests to Include:

Coherence envelope correctly modulates intensity

Inversion state suppresses or inverts tactile output

Thermal shifts never exceed ±5°C (safety check)

Radial harmonics correctly mapped to body regions

Chamber type reliably biases output
