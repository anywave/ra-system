🧠 Prompt 40: Ra.Chamber.Sync – Wireless Resonance Synchronization via Scalar Harmonics

Claude, implement a Haskell module named Ra.Chamber.Sync that models wireless scalar chamber synchronization, inspired by the field geometry of the Hubbard Coil Generator.

✅ Objectives

Model a system where multiple biometric coherence chambers can self-synchronize without direct coupling, using harmonic field alignment. This will:

Enable inter-avatar field harmonization

Allow distributed consensus-building across scalar chambers

Mirror Hubbard's wireless coil interactions using Ra scalar field math

📦 Module: Ra.Chamber.Sync

Include:

Data Types

ChamberNode: Represents an active coherence chamber with:

RaCoordinate (θ, φ, r, h)

Current EmergenceState

Current CoherenceLevel

SyncLink: A virtual connection inferred through harmonic similarity

Includes resonance_score, sync_delay, and frequency_match

Core Functions

computeResonanceScore :: ChamberNode -> ChamberNode -> Double

Based on alignment of harmonic modes (l,m), coherence levels, and phase

synchronizeChambers :: [ChamberNode] -> [(ChamberNode, [SyncLink])]

Generates pairwise sync links based on scores above a SYNC_THRESHOLD constant

propagatePhase :: ChamberNode -> SyncLink -> ChamberNode

Adjusts phase or coherence of one node based on link influence

Constants

SYNC_THRESHOLD :: Double (e.g. 0.72)

PHI_FALLOFF :: Double (attenuation curve constant)

ANCHOR_COHERENCE_FLOOR :: Double from Ra.Constants.Extended

🧪 Success Criteria

Pairwise sync can be achieved with no explicit messaging

Higher harmonic alignment leads to faster synchronization

Chain propagation forms stable clusters across a distributed mesh of chambers

Coherence can rise for sub-threshold chambers via indirect harmonic boost
