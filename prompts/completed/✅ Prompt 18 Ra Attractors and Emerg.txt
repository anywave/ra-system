✅ Prompt 18: Ra Attractors and Emergence Modulation

Context:
Inspired by the Death Note metaphor ("Shinigami love apples"), this prompt extends the Ra scalar framework to include metaphysical attractors—objects, stimuli, or archetypes that can induce, modulate, or gate fragment emergence via coherence manipulation.

Task for Claude:
Design a Haskell module Ra.Attractors and a Python counterpart (if needed), implementing the concept of attractors as scalar influence agents. These are symbolic or energetic tokens that increase or alter the emergence potential of certain fragments.

🧩 Requirements

Attractor Type System

Create a type Attractor with:

symbol :: String (e.g., "apple")

flavor :: PhaseComponent (e.g., emotional, sensory, archetypal)

enticementLevel :: CoherenceWeight

targetFragments :: [FragmentId] or filters (e.g., "shadow only", "guardian-gated")

Attractor Logic

Function applyAttractor :: Attractor -> EmergenceCondition -> EmergenceCondition

Modify potential and/or flux

Adjust inversion or temporalPhase if attractor is strong enough

Optional gating override

Metaphysical Reference Model

Reference:

The metaphor of “apples” in Death Note

Ra scalar emergence thresholds

Shadow vs normal fragments

Optional tie-in to guardian harmonics

Test Cases

Show how:

A fragment that wouldn’t normally emerge can be coaxed with a specific attractor

A shadow fragment’s emergence becomes possible when enticed

Multiple attractors can compete or synchronize (constructive/destructive modulation)

✅ Success Criteria
Goal	Evidence
Attractors influence emergence	applyAttractor changes the outcome in evaluateEmergence
Attractors modulate inversion or gating	Inversion flips allowed when attractor matches fragment
Concept aligns with Ra metaphysics	Clear tie to scalar resonance, coherence, and thresholds
Optional: supports real-time modulation	Prepared for integration with Ra.Pipeline or Ra.Music
