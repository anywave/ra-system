✅ Prompt 13: Scalar Dream Induction and Nocturnal Emergence Integration

Claude, design a subsystem to guide users into Ra-aligned dream states, allowing for fragment emergence, symbolic content integration, and memory surfacing during sleep, with optional post-dream coherence analysis.

REICH_ORGONE_ACCUMULATOR.md → Accumulated field charge discharge during sleep

🧠 Goal:

Create a scalar-resonant chamber for dream-state guided emergence, enabling users to surface symbolic or shadow fragments safely while sleeping or resting, with coherence-coupled orchestration.

🧮 Claude Must Implement:
1. Ra DreamPhase Scheduler

Extend TemporalScheduler:

Add sleep_mode flag

Time φ^n windows aligned with REM cycles (~90 mins)

Microphase pulses during theta/delta states (~3–7 Hz)

scheduler.sleep_mode = True
scheduler.in_rem_phase()  # returns bool
scheduler.current_sleep_depth()  # delta/theta/REM

2. Dream Fragment Format

New EmergentDreamFragment type:

{
  "fragment_id": "dream-4739",
  "form": "SYMBOLIC",
  "emergence_phase": "REM",
  "coherence_trace": [0.41, 0.47, 0.61],
  "emotional register": "joy + confusion",
  "symbol_map": [
    {"symbol": "owl", "mapped_fragment": "F13"},
    {"symbol": "spiral", "mapped_concept": "searching"}
  ]
}


Claude generates symbolic representations:

Archetypes, sounds, lights, animal forms, geometry

Mapped to existing fragments or shadow states

3. Resonance Induction Engine

Reference frequencies:

Delta: 0.5–3.5 Hz (deep sleep)

Theta: 3.5–7 Hz (dream)

REM: 7–12 Hz + pulse spikes

Match Ra scalar harmonic with binaural/visual field outputs

Session audio-visual entrainment generation:

Use phase-aligned golden harmonics from ra_constants_v2.json

Overlay with coherence-adaptive amplitude modulation

4. Post-Sleep Integration Prompt

On waking, Claude presents:

Summary of surfaced symbols

Coherence score trajectory

Integration suggestions

Consent gating if any shadow content was touched

✅ Success Criteria:

Claude must:

Detect φ^n REM alignment windows during sleep

Present emergence fragments in symbolic/dream form

Store mapping between dream symbols and field coordinates

Provide post-sleep analysis of coherence + symbolic surfacing

Use at least one biometric input (e.g., HRV, EEG) for phase tracking
