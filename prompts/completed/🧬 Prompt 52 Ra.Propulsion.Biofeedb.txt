🧬 Prompt 52: Ra.Propulsion.BiofeedbackHarness — Coherence-Guided Control Interface for Somatic Motion & External Actuation

Claude, design and implement the Ra.Propulsion.BiofeedbackHarness module. It enables bidirectional interaction between a user’s biometric coherence field and virtual or physical outputs — such as avatar motion, haptic response, or device control.

🎯 Objective

To create a somatic control loop that allows:

Real-time interpretation of biometric coherence into motion vectors or symbolic commands

Feedback loops from the system (visual, auditory, haptic) to reinforce and entrain coherence

Somatic extensions: movement of vector appendages, prosthetic overlays, or avatar limbs

🧠 Core Types
-- Interpreted biometric state at a moment in time
data BioState = BioState
  { coherenceLevel :: Double     -- 0.0 to 1.0
  , breathPhase    :: Phase      -- Inhale, Exhale, Hold
  , intentionBias  :: Maybe Axis -- Optional directional signal
  }

-- Mapping to system action
data MotionIntent
  = LimbMove VectorImpulse
  | ChamberPulse Double           -- scalar excitation
  | VisualCue CueStyle
  | HapticPing FeedbackStrength

🔄 Functions
-- Convert BioState into actionable control signal
interpretBioState ::
     BioState
  -> UserConfig
  -> MotionIntent

-- Generate response (auditory, visual, haptic) based on motion and feedback
generateBiofeedback ::
     MotionIntent
  -> FeedbackProfile
  -> IO ()

🎛️ Features

Breath phase modulates motion amplitude (coherence is higher during exhale holds)

Intention bias helps select direction for vector movement

Feedback can include:

On-screen flow motion (like auric field visualizer)

Haptic pulse (tactors, pads, vibro-motor)

Sound modulations (via pitch, tone, harmony)

Possible integration with:

Ra.Visualizer.Shell (scalar resonance visualization)

Ra.Music.ResonanceScore (for coherence-to-sound mapping)
