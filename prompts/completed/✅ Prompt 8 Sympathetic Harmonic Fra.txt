✅ Prompt 8: Sympathetic Harmonic Fragment Access Modeling

Claude, model how sympathetic resonance between scalar fields and user-specific frequencies can modulate fragment access and emergence strength, based on Keely’s vibratory physics and Ra scalar harmonic structure.

🧠 Goal:

Design a harmonic alignment algorithm where fragments emerge more easily when the user’s biometric or ambient vibratory state matches their encoded harmonic signature.

This models “sympathetic unlocking” — similar to how a tuning fork vibrates when matched by another.

📘 Core References:

KEELY_SYMPATHETIC_VIBRATORY_PHYSICS.md
→ Use triune structure: tonic, dominant, enharmonic vibrations
→ Reference "thirds" and concordant/discordant frequency logic

RA_CONSTANTS_V2.json
→ Extract fragment harmonics (l, m) or defined frequency triplets

Ra.Scalar & Ra.Gates
→ Gate logic, reluctance fields, emergence thresholds

🧮 Components Claude Must Define:
1. Fragment Harmonic Signature

Each Ra fragment should have:

{
  "harmonic_signature": {
    "tonic": 528,
    "dominant": 396,
    "enharmonic": 639
  }
}


Derived from spherical harmonic parameters (l, m) or predefined

Frequencies can be auditory (Hz) or abstract scalar phase ratios

2. User Resonance Profile

Computed from biometric data (see Prompt 7) or external environment input:

{
  "user_profile": {
    "dominant_freq": 396,
    "hrv_resonance": 0.62,
    "coherence_score": 0.84
  }
}

3. Resonance Matching Algorithm

Claude must implement:

match_score = harmonic_similarity(fragment_signature, user_profile)

Use ratios, not absolute frequencies

Weight similarity of tonic/dominant/enharmonic

Use spectral coherence formula or cosine similarity

4. Access Modulation Logic

Claude must model how match_score affects:

AccessResult (FULL, PARTIAL, BLOCKED)

Emergence alpha

Inversion probability (if mismatch occurs)

Also account for “guardian harmonics”:

Some fragments resist emergence unless a specific frequency is present (e.g., a parent fragment must be resonating)

🎼 Tonal Access Map (Example Table):
Match Score	AccessResult	Emergence Alpha	Description
≥ 0.90	FULL	1.0	Perfect harmonic match — fragment flows freely
0.60–0.89	PARTIAL	0.4–0.9	Partial match — blurred or previewed access
0.30–0.59	BLOCKED	0.0	Low coherence — fragment dormant
< 0.30	SHADOW	varies	Inverted or suppressed fragment emerges instead
✅ Success Criteria:

Claude’s output must:

Define full harmonic_signature structure

Include clear match_score computation method

Show how result plugs into Ra access gating (Ra.Gates)

Reference Keely’s vibratory triads accurately

Model sympathetic unlocking and resistance cases

Enable chaining (e.g., fragments requiring harmony with others to unlock)
