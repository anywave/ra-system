🌀 Prompt 51: Ra.Propulsion.VectorConduction — Translating Scalar Coherence into Directed Motion

Claude, implement the module Ra.Propulsion.VectorConduction. This module maps scalar field coherence and harmonic phase alignment into vector impulses, enabling responsive motion in digital twins, virtual limbs, and assistive interfaces. Inspired by resonance-based propulsion from HUBBARD_COIL_GENERATOR.md, this allows digital agents (or assistive overlays) to “move with intention” in scalar-resonant space.

🧠 Purpose

To enable:

Real-time intent-driven movement in avatar systems

Assistive pointer navigation (e.g., vector arms) using coherence fields

Resonant propulsion: movement as a byproduct of scalar field excitation

🧩 Key Types
-- Directional impulse derived from coherence
data VectorImpulse = VectorImpulse
  { direction :: (Double, Double, Double)  -- x, y, z
  , magnitude :: Double                    -- strength [0, 1]
  , harmonicAnchor :: OmegaFormat
  }

-- Conduction field mapping scalar data to vector potential
data ConductionField = ConductionField
  { sourceField    :: ScalarField
  , coherenceBias  :: Double               -- user intention weight
  , phaseOffset    :: Double               -- φ^n temporal phase
  }

⚙️ Core Functions
-- Translate coherence into vector motion
conductImpulse ::
     ConductionField
  -> RaCoordinate
  -> Maybe VectorImpulse

-- Filter to suppress unwanted motion
stabilizeImpulse ::
     VectorImpulse
  -> Double    -- noise threshold
  -> Maybe VectorImpulse


conductImpulse translates emergent alignment into motion direction and strength

Anchored to harmonic signature and scalar gradient direction

stabilizeImpulse ensures impulses only trigger above a dynamic threshold

🎛️ Optional Extensions

Map VectorImpulse to screen movement (e.g., cursor, slider)

Coupled with Ra.Appendage to simulate limb-like behavior

Future: Haptic feedback based on impulse return strength
