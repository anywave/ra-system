🧬 Prompt 44: Ra.Chamber.Morphology — Scalar Field-Driven Chamber Modulation

Claude, implement a module Ra.Chamber.Morphology that dynamically adapts the chamber’s structure, geometry, and response states based on live scalar field resonance gradients and emergence harmonics. This will allow AVACHATTER chambers to evolve with user coherence and field alignment.

🧭 Core Objective

Chambers are not static—they’re morphogenic constructs influenced by:

Scalar potential intensity (from Ra.Scalar)

Coherence flow (from Ra.Pipeline)

Emergence alignment (from Ra.Identity)

Biometric resonance (from Ra.Tuning)

🧱 Functional Scope
1. Chamber Morphology State
data ChamberForm
  = Egg
  | Dodecahedron
  | Toroid
  | HelixSpindle
  | CaduceusAligned
  | HarmonicShell Int  -- N harmonic shells
  deriving (Eq, Show)

2. Morphology Resolver
resolveChamberForm :: ScalarField -> UserResonanceProfile -> ChamberForm


Maps field + user into chamber shape

Takes harmonic thresholds (from KEELY, GOLOD, etc.)

If flux instability exceeds 0.3 → fallback to toroidal buffering

3. Morphing Transition Protocol
data MorphEvent
  = GradualPhaseShift ChamberForm
  | RapidCollapse
  | ResonantExpansion


Send these events to Ra.Visualizer.Shell

Allow chamber to pulse, glow, reconfigure

4. Modulator Trigger
updateMorphology :: FieldContext -> ChamberState -> (ChamberState, MorphEvent)


Integrates with biometric rhythm (heart coherence can “breathe” form)

Phase coupling → different visual modes

🧪 Success Criteria
Metric	Target
Chamber transitions	<300ms with perceptible coherence shift
Form matches field intensity tiering	Full test coverage across alpha spectrum
Resonant feedback loop established	Heart phase → chamber glow/structure
Stress-test morphs with random flux inputs	Chamber stays stable or auto-stabilizes
